1. hub: 

    The purpose of hub is to connect all of your network devices together on an internal network with ethernet to its port. hub 
    is not intelligent, because it does not filter any data or has intelligence as where data is supposed to sent. when a packet 
    comes to a port, hub copies the packet to all other ports.

2. Switch

    Switch is just like hub, but it is intelligent a switch can learn a physical address (MAC address) of connected devices,
    and send data to denstined device. 

[ATTENTION]
hubs and switches are for local network, but if you want to connect to internet, you need router.

3. Router

      a router is a device that routes or forward data from one network to another based on their ip address.

      gateway is the ip address of the router


Router jobs: 

    a. NAT (network address translation): is a method of remapping an ip address while they are in transit across a traffic 
        routing device.

    c. Firewall: prevent accessing to computers in  LAN (local area network) from outside networks(WAN: wide area network),
        if you want to allow this, you have two options, port forwarding or DMZ

    b. DMZ: DMZ or demilitarized zone is a subnetwork that contains and expose a device to an untrusted network like internet.
    
    d. Port forwarding

4. Ethernet is protocol for the communication of the devices in the LAN, first we used Coaxial cables, and now days we use 
    Twisted pair cable and Fiber optic cable.

5. Gateway and bridges are used to connect multiple Ethernet network together, gateways connect dissimilar network together, while
    bridges connect similar networks together.
